                <p class="lead text-center mb-5">Last Updated: December 26, 2025</p>
                
                <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
                <p>Welcome to Sarasaka. These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of the Sarasaka website (www.sarasaka.com), services, and any related applications (collectively, the "Services") provided by Sarasaka LLC ("Sarasaka", "we", "us", or "our"), a technology company specializing in IT services such as cybersecurity, cloud management, IT consulting, and managed IT support. By accessing or using our Services, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, you may not access or use the Services.</p>

                <h2>2. Eligibility</h2>
                <p>You must be at least 18 years old to use the Services. By agreeing to these Terms, you represent and warrant that: (a) you are at least 18 years of age; (b) you have not previously been suspended or removed from the Services; and (c) your registration and use of the Services is in compliance with any and all applicable laws and regulations.</p>

                <h2>3. Accounts and Registration</h2>
                <p>To access some features of the Services, you may be required to register for an account. When you register for an account, you may be required to provide us with some information about yourself, such as your name, email address, or other contact information. You agree that the information you provide to us is accurate and that you will keep it accurate and up-to-date at all times. When you register, you will be asked to provide a password. You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account and password, and you accept responsibility for all activities that occur under your account. If you believe that your account is no longer secure, then you must immediately notify us at business@sarasaka.com.</p>

                <h2>4. General Payment Terms</h2>
                <p>Certain features of the Services may require you to pay fees. Before you pay any fees, you will have an opportunity to review and accept the fees that you will be charged. All fees are in U.S. Dollars and are non-refundable unless otherwise specifically provided for in these Terms.</p>
                <h3>4.1 Price</h3>
                <p>Sarasaka reserves the right to determine pricing for the Services. Sarasaka will make reasonable efforts to keep pricing information published on the website up to date. We encourage you to check our website periodically for current pricing information. Sarasaka may change the fees for any feature of the Services, including additional fees or charges, if Sarasaka gives you advance notice of changes before they apply. Sarasaka, at its sole discretion, may make promotional offers with different features and different pricing to any of Sarasaka’s customers. These promotional offers, unless made to you, will not apply to your offer or these Terms.</p>
                <h3>4.2 Authorization</h3>
                <p>You authorize Sarasaka to charge all sums for the orders that you make and any level of Service you select as described in these Terms or published by Sarasaka, including all applicable taxes, to the payment method specified in your account. If you pay any fees with a credit card, Sarasaka may seek pre-authorization of your credit card account prior to your purchase to verify that the credit card is valid and has the necessary funds or credit available to cover your purchase.</p>
                <h3>4.3 Subscription Service</h3>
                <p>The Services may include automatically recurring payments for periodic charges (“Subscription Service”). If you activate a Subscription Service, you authorize Sarasaka to periodically charge, on a going-forward basis and until cancellation of either the recurring payments or your account, all accrued sums on or before the payment due date for the accrued sums. The “Subscription Billing Date” is the date when you purchase your first subscription to the Service. For information on the “Subscription Fee”, please see our pricing page. Your account will be charged automatically on the Subscription Billing Date all applicable fees and taxes for the next subscription period. The subscription will continue unless and until you cancel your subscription or Sarasaka terminates it. You must cancel your subscription before it renews in order to avoid billing of the subscription fees for the next subscription period. You can cancel your subscription by contacting us at business@sarasaka.com.</p>
                <h3>4.4 Delinquent Accounts</h3>
                <p>Sarasaka may suspend or terminate access to the Services, including fee-based portions of the Services, for any account for which any amount is due but unpaid. In addition to the amount due for the Services, a delinquent account will be charged with fees or charges that are incidental to any chargeback or collection of any the unpaid amount, including collection fees.</p>

                <h2>5. Licenses</h2>
                <h3>5.1 Limited License</h3>
                <p>Subject to your complete and ongoing compliance with these Terms, Sarasaka grants you, solely for your personal, non-commercial use, a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable license to access and use the Services.</p>
                <h3>5.2 License Restrictions</h3>

                <h3>8.2 Email</h3>
                <p>You must register with a valid email address in order to access the Services. You have the ability, but not obligation, to add a phone number to your account.

                <h3>9.1 User Content Generally</h3>
                <p>Certain features of the Services may permit users to upload content to the Services, including messages, reviews, photos, video, images, folders, data, text, and any other works (“User Content”) and to publish User Content on the Services.

                <h3>9.4 User Content Representations and Warranties</h3>
                <p>Sarasaka disclaims any and all liability in connection with User Content. You are solely responsible for your User Content and the consequences of providing User Content via the Services. By providing User Content via the Services, you affirm, represent, and warrant that:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>you are the creator and owner of the User Content, or have the necessary licenses, rights, consents, and permissions to authorize Sarasaka and users of the Services to use and distribute your User Content as necessary to exercise the licenses granted by you in this Section, in the manner contemplated by Sarasaka, the Services, and these Terms;</li>
                    <li>your User Content, and the use of your User Content as contemplated by these Terms, does not and will not: (i) infringe, violate, or misappropriate any third-party right, including any copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret, moral right, privacy right, right of publicity, or any other intellectual property or proprietary right; (ii) slander, defame, libel, or invade the right of privacy, publicity or other property rights of any other person; or (iii) cause Sarasaka to violate any law or regulation; and</li>

Sarasaka may, however, at any time and without prior notice, screen, remove, edit, or block any User Content that in our sole judgment violates these Terms or is otherwise objectionable. You understand that when using the Services, you will be exposed to User Content from a variety of sources and acknowledge that User Content may be inaccurate, offensive, indecent, or objectionable. You agree to waive, and do waive, any legal or equitable right or remedy you have or may have against Sarasaka with respect to User Content. If notified by a user or content owner that User Content allegedly does not conform to these Terms, we may investigate the allegation and determine in our sole discretion whether to remove the User Content, which we reserve the right to do at any time and without notice. For clarity, Sarasaka does not permit copyright-infringing activities on the Services.</p>
                <h3>9.6 Monitoring Content</h3>
                <p>Sarasaka does not control and does not have any obligation to monitor: (a) User Content; (b) any content made available by third parties; or (c) the use of the Services by its users. You acknowledge and agree that Sarasaka reserves the right to, and may from time to time, monitor any and all information transmitted or received through the Services for operational and other purposes. If at any time Sarasaka chooses to monitor the content, Sarasaka still assumes no responsibility or liability for content or any loss or damage incurred as a result of the use of content. During monitoring, information may be examined, recorded, copied, and used in accordance with our Privacy Policy.</p>

                <h2>16. Indemnity</h2>
                <p>To the fullest extent permitted by law, you are responsible for your use of the Services, and you will defend and indemnify Sarasaka and its officers, directors, employees, consultants, affiliates, subsidiaries and agents (together, the "Sarasaka Entities") from and against every claim brought by a third party, and any related liability, damage, loss, and expense, including reasonable attorneys' fees and costs, arising out of or connected with: (a) your unauthorized use of, or misuse of, the Services; (b) your violation of any portion of these Terms, any representation, warranty, or agreement referenced in these Terms, or any applicable law or regulation; (c) your violation of any third party right, including any intellectual property right or publicity, confidentiality, other property, or privacy right; or (d) any dispute or issue between you and any third party. We reserve the right, at our own expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you (without limiting your indemnification obligations with respect to that matter), and in that case, you agree to cooperate with our defense of those claims.</p>

                <h2>17. Disclaimers; No Warranties</h2>
                <p>THE SERVICES AND ALL MATERIALS AND CONTENT AVAILABLE THROUGH THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" AND ON AN "AS AVAILABLE" BASIS. SARASAKA DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, RELATING TO THE SERVICES AND ALL MATERIALS AND CONTENT AVAILABLE THROUGH THE SERVICES, INCLUDING: (A) ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, QUIET ENJOYMENT, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT; AND (B) ANY WARRANTY ARISING OUT OF COURSE OF DEALING, USAGE, OR TRADE. SARASAKA DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE SERVICES OR ANY PORTION OF THE SERVICES, OR ANY MATERIALS OR CONTENT OFFERED THROUGH THE SERVICES, WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, SECURE, OR FREE OF ERRORS, VIRUSES, OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS, AND SARASAKA DOES NOT WARRANT THAT ANY OF THOSE ISSUES WILL BE CORRECTED.</p>
                <p>NO ADVICE OR INFORMATION, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, OBTAINED BY YOU FROM THE SERVICES OR SARASAKA ENTITIES OR ANY MATERIALS OR CONTENT AVAILABLE THROUGH THE SERVICES WILL CREATE ANY WARRANTY REGARDING ANY OF THE SARASAKA ENTITIES OR THE SERVICES THAT IS NOT EXPRESSLY STATED IN THESE TERMS. WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE THAT MAY RESULT FROM THE SERVICES AND YOUR DEALING WITH ANY OTHER SERVICE USER. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOU USE ANY PORTION OF THE SERVICES AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK, AND THAT WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE TO YOUR PROPERTY (INCLUDING YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEM OR MOBILE DEVICE USED IN CONNECTION WITH THE SERVICES) OR ANY LOSS OF DATA, INCLUDING USER CONTENT.</p>
                <p>THE LIMITATIONS, EXCLUSIONS AND DISCLAIMERS IN THIS SECTION APPLY TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW. Sarasaka does not disclaim any warranty or other right that Sarasaka is prohibited from disclaiming under applicable law.</p>

                <h2>18. Limitation of Liability</h2>
                <p>TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL THE SARASAKA ENTITIES BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES (INCLUDING DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, GOODWILL, OR ANY OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSS) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF, OR YOUR INABILITY TO ACCESS OR USE, THE SERVICES OR ANY MATERIALS OR CONTENT ON THE SERVICES, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STATUTE, OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, AND WHETHER OR NOT ANY SARASAKA ENTITY HAS BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF DAMAGE.</p>
                <p>EXCEPT AS PROVIDED IN SECTION 19.5 AND TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE AGGREGATE LIABILITY OF THE SARASAKA ENTITIES TO YOU FOR ALL CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE USE OF OR ANY INABILITY TO USE ANY PORTION OF THE SERVICES OR OTHERWISE UNDER THESE TERMS, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE, IS LIMITED TO THE GREATER OF: (A) THE AMOUNT YOU HAVE PAID TO SARASAKA FOR ACCESS TO AND USE OF THE SERVICES IN THE 12 MONTHS PRIOR TO THE EVENT OR CIRCUMSTANCE GIVING RISE TO CLAIM; OR (B) $100.</p>
                <p>EACH PROVISION OF THESE TERMS THAT PROVIDES FOR A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY, DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES, OR EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES IS INTENDED TO AND DOES ALLOCATE THE RISKS BETWEEN THE PARTIES UNDER THESE TERMS. THIS ALLOCATION IS AN ESSENTIAL ELEMENT OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN THE PARTIES. EACH OF THESE PROVISIONS IS SEVERABLE AND INDEPENDENT OF ALL OTHER PROVISIONS OF THESE TERMS. THE LIMITATIONS IN THIS SECTION 18 WILL APPLY EVEN IF ANY LIMITED REMEDY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.</p>

                <h2>19. Dispute Resolution and Arbitration</h2>
                <h3>19.1 Generally</h3>
                <p>In the interest of resolving disputes between you and Sarasaka in the most expedient and cost effective manner, and except as described in Section 19.2, you and Sarasaka agree that every dispute arising in connection with these Terms will be resolved by binding arbitration. Arbitration is less formal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. This agreement to arbitrate disputes includes all claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of these Terms, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether a claim arises during or after the termination of these Terms. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND SARASAKA ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.</p>
                <h3>19.2 Exceptions</h3>
                <p>Despite the provisions of Section 19.1, nothing in these Terms will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit the right of either party to: (a) bring an individual action in small claims court; (b) pursue an enforcement action through the applicable federal, state, or local agency if that action is available; (c) seek injunctive relief in a court of law in aid of arbitration; or (d) to file suit in a court of law to address an intellectual property infringement claim.</p>
                <h3>19.3 Arbitrator</h3>
                <p>Any arbitration between you and Sarasaka will be settled under the Federal Arbitration Act and administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) under its Consumer Arbitration Rules (collectively, “AAA Rules”) as modified by these Terms. The AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by contacting Sarasaka. The arbitrator has exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, or enforceability of this binding arbitration agreement.</p>
                <h3>19.4 Notice of Arbitration; Process</h3>
                <p>A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other party by certified U.S. Mail or by Federal Express (signature required) or, only if that other party has not provided a current physical address, then by electronic mail (“Notice of Arbitration”). Sarasaka’s address for Notice is: Sarasaka LLC, 8524 Richland Colony Rd, Knoxville TN, 37923. The Notice of Arbitration must: (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought (“Demand”). The parties will make good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if the parties do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice of Arbitration is received, you or Sarasaka may commence an arbitration proceeding. All arbitration proceedings between the parties will be confidential unless otherwise agreed by the parties in writing. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Sarasaka must not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any. If the arbitrator awards you an amount higher than the last written settlement amount offered by Sarasaka in settlement of the dispute prior to the award, Sarasaka will pay you the higher of: (i) the amount awarded by the arbitrator; or (ii) $10,000.</p>
                <h3>19.5 Fees</h3>
                <p>If you commence arbitration in accordance with these Terms, Sarasaka will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for more than $10,000, in which case the payment of any fees will be decided by the AAA Rules. Any arbitration hearing will take place at a location to be agreed upon in Knox County, Tennessee, but if the claim is for $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted: (a) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; (b) through a non-appearance based telephone hearing; or (c) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address. If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In that case, you agree to reimburse Sarasaka for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator must issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.</p>
                <h3>19.6 No Class Actions</h3>
                <p>YOU AND SARASAKA AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and Sarasaka agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.</p>
                <h3>19.7 Modifications to this Arbitration Provision</h3>
                <p>If Sarasaka makes any future change to this arbitration provision, other than a change to Sarasaka's address for Notice of Arbitration, you may reject the change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to Sarasaka’s address for Notice of Arbitration, in which case your account with Sarasaka will be immediately terminated and this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the changes you rejected will survive.</p>
                <h3>19.8 Enforceability</h3>
                <p>If Section 19.6 is found to be unenforceable or if the entirety of this Section 19 is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Section 19 will be null and void and, in that case, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 20 will govern any action arising out of or related to these Terms.</p>

                <h2>20. Miscellaneous</h2>
                <p>These Terms, including the Privacy Policy and any other agreements expressly incorporated by reference into these Terms, are the entire and exclusive understanding and agreement between you and Sarasaka regarding your use of the Services. You may not assign or transfer these Terms or your rights under these Terms, in whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise, without our prior written consent. We may assign these Terms at any time without notice or consent. The failure to require performance of any provision will not affect our right to require performance at any other time after that, nor will a waiver by us of any breach or default of these Terms, or any provision of these Terms, be a waiver of any subsequent breach or default or a waiver of the provision itself. Use of section headers in these Terms is for convenience only and will not have any impact on the interpretation of any provision. Throughout these Terms the use of the word "including" means "including but not limited to". If any part of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the unenforceable part will be given effect to the greatest extent possible, and the remaining parts will remain in full force and effect.</p>

                <h2>21. Governing Law</h2>
                <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of Tennessee without regard to conflict of law principles. You and Sarasaka submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the state courts and federal courts located within Knox County, Tennessee for resolution of any lawsuit or court proceeding permitted under these Terms. We operate the Services from our offices in Tennessee, and we make no representation that Materials included in the Services are appropriate or available for use in other locations.</p>

                <h2>22. Consent to Electronic Communications</h2>

Please read our Privacy Policy to learn more about our electronic communications practices. You agree that any notices, agreements, disclosures, or other communications that we send to you electronically will satisfy any legal communication requirements, including that those communications be in writing.</p>
